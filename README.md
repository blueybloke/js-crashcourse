# JavaScript Crash-Course

## What is this?
This a repository of small exercises and projects that I am doing while I get up to speed with Javascript.
JS is something I have wanted to learn for a while now, and while I have a bit of familiarity with it I am
making these projects as a way of learning both the conventions and the ins and outs of JS. 
All of this repo is free to use and do what you want with ðŸ˜„

## Structure
Each folder corresponds with some set of exercises, side project, or tutorial I have worked on.
